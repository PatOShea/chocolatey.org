    <h2>About Chocolatey</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows (like apt-get or yum but for
        Windows)</strong>. It was designed to be a <strong>decentralized</strong> framework
        for quickly installing applications and tools that you need. It is built on the
        NuGet infrastructure currently using PowerShell as its focus for delivering packages
        from the distros to your door, err computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chocolatey is brought to you by the work and inspiration of the community, the work
        and thankless nights of the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/chocolatey/people">
        Chocolatey Team</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder">Rob</a> heading
        up the direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can <strong>host your own sources</strong> and add them to Chocolatey, you can
        extend Chocolatey's capabilities, and folks, it's only going to get better.
    </p>
    <p>
        With all of this in mind, <strong>think of Chocolatey as a framework</strong> that
        you can build on top of. <a href="https://supermarket.getchef.com/cookbooks/chocolatey">
        Chef</a>, <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/rismoney/chocolatey">Puppet</a>, <a href="http://docs.saltstack.com/en/develop/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.chocolatey.html">Salt</a>,
        and <a href="https://boxstarter.org">Boxstarter</a> all have ways for using Chocolatey
        to ensure the state of a computer and packages installed. <strong><em>Even Microsoft
        has decided to use Chocolatey's framework</em></strong> with the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/OneGet/oneget">
        OneGet</a> client! See Jeffrey Snover's <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowsserver/archive/2014/04/03/windows-management-framework-v5-preview.aspx">

    <h2>About Chocolatey.org</h2>
    <p>
        Chocolatey.org is a feed of packages provided and maintained by the community. If
        you are a business looking at using Chocolatey, it is strongly recommended that
        you do not use the community feed. See the question below on trusting the community
        feed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chocolatey.org is currently a fork of the NuGet gallery. Over time Chocolatey.org
        is planned to be rewritten as a totally custom website. The Chocolatey team has
        over 20 years of experience in writing fast, efficient and secure websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Package moderation and package signing are planned to increase the security of the
        community feed. Bear with us, this is going to take time to get into place. The
        plan is that a moderator would review and sign off on a package with a cryptographic
        key. Users of Chocolatey would only need to trust moderators. As moderators are
        shifted, updates of Chocolatey will reflect this. There will also be an out of band
        way for users to trust a new maintainer.

    <h2>About the Official Chocolatey Client</h2>
    <p>
        The official Chocolatey client is the one you get from chocolatey.org on the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey">
        package page</a>. This is the only official client. ChocolateyGUI is a recognized
        client that is an extension of the official client. It is recommended you use the
        official client as it has the latest security fixes, the latest features, and is
        supported by the Chocolatey team.
    </p>
    <p>
        The official client is currently being rewritten in C# for a much faster and more
        stable experience using Chocolatey. Look for that to debut near the end of 2014
        if not sooner.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>What is the difference between Chocolatey and NuGet?</strong> NuGet is for
        development libraries, Chocolatey is a binary machine package manager. Typically
        you can think of it like this: <strong><em>"You use NuGet to get 3rd party libraries
        that you use to build the applications/tools that you host on Chocolatey."</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do I contact the Chocolatey group?</strong> The best way to do this
        is to use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/chocolatey">official mailing
        list</a> (see the forum link above).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why can't I see my post on the mailing list?</strong> First time posters
        are moderated to cut down on spammers. Be patient and we will post your message.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Why is my software listed here? I haven't given anyone distribution permission!</strong>
        Many times the way Chocolatey works is to use PowerShell to download the package
        from the official distribution point, this way no distribution rules are broken.
        This is not always the case so feel free to reach out to the site administrators
        (the email address is chocolateywebadmin at google groups dot com) if you do have
        questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>I am the owner of software listed here and would like to maintain the package.</strong>
        That's awesome to hear! The way this works out is to use the contact site admins
        link on the package page and we will handle reaching out to the current maintainers
        for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do I know if I can trust the community feed (the packages on this site?)</strong>
        Until we have package moderation in place, the answer is that you can't trust the
        packages here. If you require trust (e.g. most organizations require this), you
        should have an internal feed with vetted packages using internal resources. You
        should always decide whether you trust the maintainer(s) of the package, and even
        then you may want to inspect the package prior to installing. You can inspect packages
        easily with <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/nugetpackageexplorer">nuget
        package explorer</a> or by clicking download on the package page (and then treating
        the nupkg as a zip archive).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>There is a package that has is broken, needs updating or something else.</strong>
        Please use the contact maintainers link to let them know. Many packages also have
        github repositories where the maintainers keep the packages. If you go to a maintainer's
        profile (linked from package page, click on maintainer), their profiles will many
        times include the link to the github repository where they keep their packages.
        If contacting the maintainer or filing a Pull Request doesn't get the package updated
        within a certain amount of time, there are steps we can take to TOS a package. This
        is known as the <a title="Package Triage Process" href="https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/PackageTriageProcess">
        Package Triage Process</a>.

    <p>
        <strong>Are there plans to offer a pro version of Chocolatey?</strong> Yes! Ultimately
        there are some things that we want to offer that are not free to us, so we can't
        offer them for free. We believe these things are important for the community, so
        we want to offer an even more stable and safe experience.

    <p>
        <strong>I need a support contract.</strong> We can work with you on that. Please
        contact the site administrators (the email address is chocolateywebadmin at google
        groups dot com) and we will route you to the correct folks. In time this will be
        better automated to set up. Bear with us as we improve this aspect of our service.
